In the 9th session of our Corpus Linguistics lecture, we spoke about how important it is, to use corpora in language testing.
With the past years, there was a trend of going away from human judgement of english skills to using corpora based information because it is more objective (i.e. the learner corpus research),

The common European Framework of Reference for language (CEFR) is the common guideline in order to describe the L2 level of a person. It reaches from A1, which is the best level to C2 which is the worst of the 6 levels. Every of the four general skills like reading, writing, listening and speaking is graded and in the end gives a final grade (A1-C2). Some time ago, these grades were given by human judgement. They listened for example and just rate the probant, but this human rating sets out to be very inconsistant. And that is why a lot of researches are now using those corpora based information which seems to be more consistent for a good rating.

There are also three main approaches to using learner corpora in language assessment. First the corpus informed approach that uses corpora as just a reference. Second the corpus based approach that uses corpora as source of data for linguistic researches and at last the corpus driven approach which does not use any hypothesis in its research but uses the corpus after the research to look up if there are any special things the research could point out.To use the corpora properly and faster, there are certain programs, people use. I.e. CoCoGen, TAALES and COH-METRIX.

You could use this corpora to look for example at the cohesion of a L2s text. Cohesion is the most important thing in a text and is a very good indicator for writing skills. With corpus based information, there is no human judgement needed because certain programms could do the work way more effective and objective.
