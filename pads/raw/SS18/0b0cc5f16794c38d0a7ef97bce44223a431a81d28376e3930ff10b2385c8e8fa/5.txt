In our corpus linguistics session 6 we  had a minor introduction to the learners corpus and were shown two case studies.
Learner corpora are electronic collections of natural written data of L2 learners, also called L2-Corpora. It gives us the possibility to be able to have a larger reflection of how language lerning works. Looking at students exams for example will not be representatve enough because on the one hand, the design is too vague and on the other hands it is not enough written data if you just decide to look at one class or even one school.
Design considerations for an L2 corpora may be just looking on the first four grades of german english learners, too observe language learning in the first steps. Obviously important factors here would be age, mother language and a representative number of people.

The main goals and aims of Learner Corpus Research is to understand the language learning process in order to show possible problems, english learners could have with learning the language. So it serves for a language accessement and shows typical difficulties.

The third and last thing we learned in the lecture are the two case studies, which I am going to explain briefly in the following.
Case Study 1 (CS1) is a cross-sectional study. We access language performance at a specific point of time and focus on formulait language. In order to compare, we have to look expecially at L1 and L2 learners. We look at the differences of the means in different corpora and decide if those differences are significant (if we can say that there is a difference).
Case Study 2 (CS2) is longitudinal. We track a development over the time and focus on grammatical complexity (for example comparing the grammatical complexity of our learning journals from session 1 to session ending). Here, we do not compare two groups, but one group at two different stages of their L2 learning and how their grammatical behaviour in terms of formulait language, structure, tenses, etc. changes.
