The beginnings in the 1970s start with the Chomskian Generative Grammar as a predominant theory in the linguistics.,2785,2900,../../preprocess/data/2.txt,21,115.0,52604.0
"It includes the question of the extent to which innate UG principles and parameters accessible in second language acquisition and also the fundamental similarity or difference between the first and second language, but as well between childish and adult learning.",2901,3164,../../preprocess/data/2.txt,22,263.0,72044.0
