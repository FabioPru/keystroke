1. D finition of Contrastive Linguistics (CL) and a short historical background of CL reseach: 
     Contrastive Linguistic is a systematic comparison of two languages, including the aim to identify and describe their similarities and differences. It's originated in the 1940's and 1960's with an educational approach  The approach is about the difficulty of second language learning. It's about the transfer and tendancy of L2-learners to reuse structures of their L1. The focus has been the negative transfer of the structure. Later, in empirical studies, a difference between the problems which has been forcasted and the ones that act aly occured. In the 1980's the branch of comparative linguisics became theoreticaly. A  ew framework was adopted to classify these contrasts and similarities which have been observed under investigation. 
2. Sketch the major morphological differences between English and German. Focus on at least two differences:
         English: 
             - Articles and adjectives aren't marked for case
             - Nouns can only occur in two different forms - marked for cases or marked for possessives
             - Pronouns can have an additional object form
         German: 
             - concord
             - government
          The  ontrast between the two languages is that german has retained numerous inflectional endings to mark mood, number and person. English however has a higher degree of analyticity. 
3. Sketch the major word order differences between English and German and discuss constraints and options these differences give rise to.
Where English is characterised by its fixed word order without inflections  German is relatively free in its word order. English developed new orders, therefore there are defts and pseudo-defts.  he Constraints and options are: Form-function mappings, fused constructions and argument trespassing across clause boundaries, s ntence constituents (espacially verb arguments) move across these clause boundaries, the semantic roles of subject and the passive. 
4. Sketch the major phonological differences between English and German. Focus either on (1) contrasting the vowel inventories of English and German or (2) contrasting the consonant inventories of English and German or (3) phonotatic differences between English and German. 
(3)  In German the main stress is usually placed on the first element, whereas in English it often happens that more than one element is stressed. T e main stress in English can even be on the second or third element of a compound. Another difference is the r ythm.  lthough English and German are both stress-timed languages, syllable stress in English is much more isochronous than in Germannn
