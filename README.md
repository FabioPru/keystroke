## Dataset

The dataset we are working on consists of the keystroke data produced at RWTH over the last four semesters. Each of 650 students wrote between 6-13 files.

This totals to 2786045 words ready for analysis.

## Folder structure

- frontend: interface for accessing the CoCoGen tool for computing complexity scores. Provided by RWTH Aachen, ask Marcus for access/details.

- lib: Etherpad and changeset libraries

- literatures: papers we read in the first weeks for context and introductions to the field

- pads: clean data in .csv files. pads/raw/ is the data we had at the beginning. Start from this if you want to work on this project

- papers: final reports and publications. the inner folder contains more background and timelines etc.

- src: our code. All folders are preprocessing except the Jupyter notebooks in src/ipynb/. If you trust our data cleaning, the notebooks are all it's worth to look at.
